## Research Interests

I work on **explainable AI (XAI)** and **unsupervised anomaly detection**, with a focus on:
- Novel evaluation frameworks for unsupervised models (see [ASOI metric](https://github.com/jiyanMahmud/ASOI_ASI
))
- Model-agnostic and model-specific explanation methods: SHAP, LIME, WindowLIME
- Graph-based anomaly propagation and root cause attribution
- Language-based anomaly reasoning and log modeling
- User-facing explainability interfaces and real-time XAI dashboards

I am Principal Investigator on two industry-funded projects with **Deutsche Telekom Innovation Laboratories**, and hold an **EKOP Research Scholarship** from ELTE for independent fundamental research.
